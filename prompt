# Generic instructions

Subject: I built a preview of a new website for [Business Name]

Hi [Owner Name or "Team"],

I was looking at your Google Maps listing and noticed you don’t have a dedicated website.

Since you have such great reviews, I took the liberty of putting together a modern, fast-loading homepage for [Business Name] to show you what a professional digital presence could look like.

You can view the preview here: [Link to Mockup/Draft]

I build these specifically for local service businesses. My model is simple:

$50 one-time setup: This covers the initial build and getting everything live.

$5/month hosting: This keeps the site online, secure, and lightning-fast.

There is no long-term contract or hidden fees. I just want to help local businesses get a professional edge without the agency price tag.

If you like the look of it, I can have the full site live on your own domain by tomorrow. If not, no hard feelings!

Best regards,

Andrew from Nuri [links to nuri.software]
